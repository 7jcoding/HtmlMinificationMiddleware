# HTML Minification middleware for ASP.NET 5

Minification refers to the process of removing unnecessary or redundant data without affecting how the resource is processed by the browser - e.g. code comments and formatting, removing unused code, using shorter variable and function names, and so on. This repository contains source code of an ASP.NET 5 middleware which helps to minify HTML.
